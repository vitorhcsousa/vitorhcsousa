## üéØ My Focus Areas

My work centers on pushing the boundaries of AI, from foundational research to real-world application. I am particularly focused on:

* ü§ñ **Generative AI & Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Expertise in advanced LLMs, covering specialized fine-tuning (Transformers, Diffusion models), building applications with AI reasoning (RAG, agents), and rigorous evaluation for performance, safety, and alignment.
* üìä **Advanced Data Engineering for Generative AI**: Specialized in data strategies for GenAI: strategic dataset creation (curation, augmentation, synthesis) for LLMs, ensuring data quality & governance, and building high-performance data pipelines for large-scale models.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **AI Model Performance & Efficiency Optimization**: Optimizing AI models through advanced compression (quantization, pruning, PEFT), resource-aware development, efficient inference and serving strategies for large models, and continuous performance monitoring.
* üìà **ML Engineering & Operations (MLOps)**: Driving robust MLOps for the full ML lifecycle‚Äîfrom data ingestion and training, through thorough evaluation and versioning, to deployment and continuous monitoring‚Äîall on scalable, efficient AI infrastructure.
